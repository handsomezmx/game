# game

In this game, a word is chosen randomly from a list, and the player has to guess the letters in the word. The player can guess one letter at a time, and if the letter is in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed. If the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, they lose a guess. The game ends when the player guesses all the letters in the word or runs out of guesses.
